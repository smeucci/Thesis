\section{Dataset}

The dataset used in this thesis is composed of video coming from smartphones and tablets with operating system \emph{Android} and \emph{iOS}. 
Videos that have an \emph{Android} acquisition device have a file container that follows the standard of the MP4 \cite{mp4} file format while videos that have an \emph{iOS} acquisition device have a file container that follows the standard of the MOV file format \cite{mov}.
The full list of devices of our dataset can be seen from Table \ref{devices}).

\label{devices}
\end{table}


For each device, we have videos that are directly acquired and the same videos that have been modified by different means:

\begin{itemize}
\item videos that have been uploaded and then downloaded from 	\emph{Youtube}.
\item videos that have been modified using the software tool \emph{Ffmpeg} \cite{}.
\item videos that have been modified using the software tool \emph{Exiftool} \cite{}.
\end{itemize}
