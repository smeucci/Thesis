First and foremost, I have to thank my research supervisors, Prof. Alessandro Piva and Prof. Fabrizio Argenti for their assistance and dedicated involvement in every step throughout the process.

I would also like to express my warm thanks to Ing. Marco Fontani and Dott. Massimo Iuliani. Without their patient support and guidance,  this thesis would have never been accomplished.

Finally, as always, I thank myself for staying strong.
